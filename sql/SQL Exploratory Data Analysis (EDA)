1. Row Counts per Table

Check that each dataset loaded correctly.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers FROM Customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders FROM Orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRMA FROM RMA;
```

2. Verify Primary Key Uniqueness

Ensure there are no duplicate IDs.

```sql
-- Customers
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Customers
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Orders
SELECT OrderID, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- RMA
SELECT RMAID, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM RMA
GROUP BY RMAID
HAVING COUNT(*
) > 1;
```

3. Check Foreign Key Integrity

Ensure Orders map to valid Customers and RMAs map to valid Orders.

```sql
-- Orders referencing missing customers
SELECT *
FROM Orders o
LEFT JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.CustomerID IS NULL;

-- RMA referencing missing orders
SELECT *
FROM RMA r
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON r.OrderID = o.OrderID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;
```

4. Order and RMA Date Ranges

Review timeline consistency.

```sql
SELECT MIN(OrderDate) AS EarliestOrder, MAX(OrderDate) AS LatestOrder
FROM Orders;

SELECT MIN(ReturnDate) AS EarliestRMA, MAX(ReturnDate) AS LatestRMA
FROM RMA;
```

5. Orders per Customer

Identify purchasing activity and high-volume customers.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    CONCAT(c.FirstName, ' ', c.LastName) AS CustomerName,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;
```

6. Returns per Product

Understand which products are returned most often.

```sql
SELECT 
    o.ProductName,
    COUNT(r.RMAID) AS TotalReturns
FROM Orders o
JOIN RMA r ON o.OrderID = r.OrderID
GROUP BY o.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalReturns DESC;
```

7. Return Reasons Frequency

Analyze trends in why customers return products.

```sql
SELECT 
    ReturnReason,
    COUNT(*) AS Frequency
FROM RMA
GROUP BY ReturnReason
ORDER BY Frequency DESC;
```

8. RMA Status Breakdown

Quick snapshot of processing stages.

```sql
SELECT 
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM RMA
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY Total DESC;
```

9. Time Between Order and RMA

Evaluate customer return behavior.

```sql
SELECT 
    r.RMAID,
    o.ProductName,
    DATEDIFF(r.ReturnDate, o.OrderDate) AS DaysBetween
FROM RMA r
JOIN Orders o ON r.OrderID = o.OrderID
ORDER BY DaysBetween DESC;
```

10. Full Customer–Order–RMA Relationship

High-level view of all connected data.

```sql
SELECT
    r.RMAID,
    r.Status,
    r.ReturnReason,
    o.OrderID,
    o.ProductName,
    c.CustomerID,
    CONCAT(c.FirstName, ' ', c.LastName) AS CustomerName
FROM RMA r
JOIN Orders o ON r.OrderID = o.OrderID
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
ORDER BY r.RMAID;
```
